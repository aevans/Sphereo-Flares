1. Programmatically access one or more `STEREO` images to be visualized using a `Sphero`
2. Process the images to determine average color, timing data, solar flare events, and related data
3. Convert color, timing, and solar flare event data into a format useable by `Sphero`
  - a macro for the `Sphero MacroLab` application
  - an input file to a program that can communicate with a `Sphero`
  - an actual program that can directly control a `Sphero`
4. Create an online tool that will generate macros for the above data based on a query usable by `STEREO`
5. Add functionality to expand, modify, and share existing macros through the online tool
6. Add a push notification event for major solar flare activity that can be processed by a `Sphero` setup to handle such events
7. Create a tool that will set a `Sphero` to the current activity level for the latest image data available from `STEREO`
