Abstract:
=======

Use a Sphero's color LED [1] to mimic solar flare activity data provided by the STEREO image gallery [2] and related data.


Goals:
=====

- Generate a macro for use by the Sphero MacroLab application [3] that mimics a timelapse photo set of solar flare activity.
- Convert image data [2] provided by STEREO into RGB color sets for use in macros and other projects.
- Generate custom macros on-the-fly based on the above RGB color sets.
- Generate an online cache of image sets to RGB color sets to make the color data available without the image processing overhead.
- Program Sphero directly using the Artoo micro-framework for robotics [4]. Display the 'latest' image [5] provided by STEREO, or query for a custom set of images, or poll the data for realtime updates as new images become available.
- Push realtime solar flare activity to a Sphero instead of using a pull mechanism.
- Cause the Sphero to rumble for notifications of major solar flare activity.
